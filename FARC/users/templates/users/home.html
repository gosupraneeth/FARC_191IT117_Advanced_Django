                            This is the mother of all buildings at NITK. Here lies the Administration office and all the
                            officials’ office. From the
                            Dean and the Director to the peon, everyone’s office can be found here. Visit this place for
                            all official purposes. ( A
                            word of warning, don’t enter this building in shorts or you are done for :P)
    
                            There are two seminar halls in this building namely - Main Seminar Hall (MSH) and the ISTE
                            seminar hall. Regular
                            seminars and (boring :P) quizzes take place here.
    
                            And then lastly there is a restaurant called Samudra Darshan on the top floor where you can
                            have regular
                            breakfast/lunch. The panoramic view from there is one not to be missed.
    
                            Often during exams, students can be found studying here up to late night. However with first
                            years having their block
                            timings, this isn't of much use to them!

                            also known as HCC is a
                            unique facility. Free doctors + medicine! You really couldn’t ask for
                            more. Many private colleges do not have such a facility. It is situated in the centre of the
                            campus opposite the main
                            grounds.
    
                            Plus, in case of emergency there is always a doctor in NITK Campus. NITK has recently
                            inducted 2 24-hour ambulances for
                            emergency. All this for just Rs. 815 a year. :P
    
                            Do you know that you will be covered under a medical insurance by HCC, NITK ? This is
                            provided by Vidal Health
                            Administrative Services which will provide you with a health card and a list of hospitals
                            where you can avail this
                            service. It's available throughout Karnataka in almost all major hospitals :P.</p>

                            is segregated into two wings.
    
                            Periodicals, journals and bound volumes are accessible in the Western wing, while books are

                            digital library facility is also present. There is also an AC room to find respite from the

                            1960, the Department of
                            Mechanical Engineering has traversed the path of knowledge dissemination
                            and generation. The department feels proud about producing over 4500 Mechanical Engineering
                            graduates to serve the
                            Nation. Over these glorious years of its journey, it has carved a niche for itself in the
                            key areas of teaching,
                            research, consultancy, administration and community services. The Department of Mechanical
                            Engineering gives priority to
                            update the Mechanical Engineering education, primarily driven by the dynamics of
                            technological advances and sustainable
                            development and the curriculum is revised on a continuous basis with active involvement of
                            industry, alumni, research
                            organizations and other stakeholders. The department offers B.Tech, M.Tech and Ph.D.
                            programmes and caters to more than
                            600 B.Tech. students, 150 M.Tech. students and 90 Ph.D. Scholars.</p>

                        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: smaller; font-family:Georgia;text-align:justify;">The beach is one of the
                            major things that a
                            fresher at NITK brags about all the time to his or her friends. After all,
                            no other college in India has a private beach like ours!In the first couple of days, NITK
                            holds a welcoming for all
                            freshers on the beach, under the banner of
                            'High Tea'. Nothing very 'high' about it, though; banana chips, a sweet, and some juice.
                            Where's the tea?
                            Your guess is as good as mine.
    
                            So what's the beach like? A cool sea breeze, sand between your toes, the lapping of the
                            waves against you... it's a
                            wonderful feeling. Naturally, the beach is a place to go and hang out with friends. It takes
                            approximately fifteen to
                            twenty minutes to get there from the boys' hostel, and not more than ten from the girls'.
                            This walk to and from the
                            beach is also a memorable part of the excursion.</p>

                            is a lighthouse next to a temple, both situated quite close to the beach.
                            But be careful, as the lighthouse is notorious for housing beehives. To reach these, one
                            normally exits the eastern
                            campus through the SBI Gate and walks towards Surathkal, crosses the road and uses the

                        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: smaller; font-family:Georgia;text-align:justify;">SJA is a huge auditorium
                            that regularly hosts
                            major events of NITK. Formed to commemorate NITK's Silver Jubilee, it is
                            the projection of NITK’s pride as one of the top engineering institutions in the country.
    
                            The SJA has a capacity of around 1000. It is fully air conditioned and also has a balcony
                            housing. SJA is decked up for
                            all major occasions and looks rather stunning during the nights. As a fresher one should not
                            miss the Musical Nights and
                            the Movies that are screened over here. Those are truly performances worth cherishing (and
                            the AC worth sitting for!
                            :p).
    
                            It basically serves as an auxiliary to the Students Activity Center (SAC). Noted musicians
                            and vocalists regularly visit
                            and give performances in this auditorium. Films are regularly screened by the Films’ Club
                            and block timings are extended
                            during the screening of these films!</p>

                            beside the HCC and in front of the basketball court. It's quite a serene and
                            calm place on a normal day. It is often used as a popular hangout place by most people
                            during the evenings.
    
                            Come the fests and this place will be busy buzzing with students as all the major
                            performances and events take place
                            here. Every night during INCI and two of the nights during ENGINEER this place is filled
                            with people waiting for the
                            band events or the DJ Show.</p>
